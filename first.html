            <b> Computer science and engineering (CSE)</b> or Computer Science (CS) also integrated as <strong>Electrical engineering and Computer Science (EECS)</strong> in some universities, is an <i>academic program</i> at many universities which comprises approaches of <em>computer science and computer engineering</em>.

            <p style="background-color: cadetblue; color: white;">
             There is no clear division in computing between <mark>
                science and engineering
             </mark>, just like in the field of materials science and engineering.

             However, some classes are historically more related to computer science (e.g. <small>data structures and algorithms</small>), and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer <del>Design</del> <ins>architecture</ins>). CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of technical or engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.<sup>[1]</sup>
